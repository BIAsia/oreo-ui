/**
 * Oreo UI Icon — one adapter over whichever icon set is active.
 *
 * Call sites name the *meaning* of a glyph, never a library's spelling of it:
 *
 *   <Icon name="chevron-down" weight="bold" />
 *
 * The name resolves through the registry using the library from
 * `IconLibraryProvider` (Phosphor by default), so swapping the whole system
 * over to Lucide is one prop on one provider.
 *
 * Sizing and color are driven by Tailwind tokens (via `currentColor`) rather
 * than either library's numeric `size`/`color` props, so icons inherit color
 * from their container. Inside surfaces like `IconButton` the parent's
 * `[&_svg]:size-*` rule wins, so an `<Icon>` placed there scales automatically.
